## Meme Generator - API client
As we learn about provisioning applications to enterprise users, we need to step into architecture patterns (not entirely new to you) with a look at API's. Before we build an API, let's use an existing one to build an app.

In this activity, you will be generating a web app which allows users to generate their own memes. Use VS Code on your Ubuntu VM
1. Go to the imgflip API documentation and explore the features offered by the API.
2. Think about the following: How much do we know about the underlying structure? Where is the DB? What type of DB? What are the advantages/disadvantages of an app structured in this way?
3. On launch show the Top 100 meme templates to the user
4. Allow the user to select the meme that they would like to customise and allow them to enter the captions.
5. Using the imgflip API, generate and display the meme for the user.
6. Push your app to a GitHub repo so you can work from anywhere.
