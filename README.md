2. Install dotnet SDK
3. Install VS Code
4. Create a new dotnet console application and output hello world. Make sure its in a dev folder under your user directory.
5. Push your app to a GitHub repo

3. In the comments, make sure that you explain, in detail, how your application adhere's to SOLID.
4. Add in the functionality to store data persistently (you choose how, I just want to see SOLID being implemented)
5. Draw a UML class diagram (using any tool).
6. Push your repo to GitHub and drop the link in Teams.

Good luck
